Recently, offloading tasks from smartphones to cloud servers has been a promising strategy for
improving smartphone capabilities and battery life.
The efficiency of task offloading is determined by taking into account communication costs
and energy consumption, which are considered crucial factors, both of which enable smart
devices to make the right decisions about whether or not to perform a task.
In this work, a framework is designed to improve the energy efficiency of mobile devices by
taking into account various system parameters such as remote cloud servers, local smartphone
resources with or without task offloading and radio access networks. The task offloading
framework uses a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), to schedule
tasks by optimizing system parameters, resulting in an optimal task scheduling decision. GWO
schedules tasks optimally to enable unrestricted communication between the mobile device and
the cloud server. This reduces the energy consumption of mobile devices.
The GWO Offloading framework is simulated using the CloudSim simulation tool, and the
results are compared with other algorithms in terms of various parameters.
